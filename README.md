This project combines SQL database queries and an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze OLA ride data. It provides valuable insights into bookings, revenue, cancellations, customer behaviour, and performance metrics across different vehicle types.

ðŸ”¹ SQL Part (Back-End Analysis):

Created database schema and multiple SQL views for ride analysis.

Key queries include:

Successful bookings and total successful booking value

Average ride distance by vehicle type

Top 5 customers by ride bookings

Cancelled rides (by customers & drivers) with reasons

Maximum & minimum driver ratings for specific vehicle types (e.g., Prime Sedan)

Rides by payment method (UPI, Cash, Cards)

Average customer ratings by vehicle type

Incomplete rides with reasons

ðŸ”¹ Power BI Part (Front-End Visualization):

Overall Performance: Total bookings (103K+), booking value (35M), ride trends over time, booking status breakdown.

Vehicle Type Analysis: Comparison of booking value, success rate, and distance traveled across Sedan, SUV, Auto, Bike, and E-Bike.

Revenue Insights: Revenue split by payment method, top customers, and daily ride distance distribution.

Cancellation Insights: Reasons for cancellations by customers and drivers, succeeded vs. cancelled ride ratios.

Ratings Dashboard: Driver vs. customer ratings by vehicle type, highlighting service quality.

âœ… Outcome:

This end-to-end project demonstrates how SQL is used for data preparation & analysis, while Power BI visualizes the results into an interactive dashboard. The insights help OLA in reducing cancellations, improving service quality, identifying top-performing vehicle types, and optimizing revenue strategies.
